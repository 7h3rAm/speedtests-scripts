# Private Internet Access Speedtests

In order to enhance the customer experience, this project is aimed to monitor throughput speeds on all Private Internet Access regions in order to identify and resolve throughput issues as expidited as possible.

## Getting Started

By open sourcing the code base and instructions, this allows all users to replicate the test results to ensure accuracy, transparecy and faster issue replication and resolution. Any user can replicate the data in order to verify the results as some VPN providers sometimes compress data in order to achieve faster throughput speed results.


### Installing

1. To do... create step by step process to verify.
